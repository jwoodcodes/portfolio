notes from how to building an effecctive dev portfilio

We need to do some work to showcase those projects, though. Even the most amazing
portfolio project might be overlooked if an employer only sees a couple screenshots and a
Github link. We need to guide potential employers through our work, making sure to
highlight the most interesting, impressive, salient parts. The good stuff. Stuff that isn't
always obvious at first glance.

While the
portfolio site is just one piece of the job-hunting puzzle, it’s a piece that can have an
outsized impact

Unless you already have extensive work experience, your side projects are the greatest asset
you have. They are your trophies, and the portfolio site is the trophy case that highlights all
the amazing stuff you’ve done.
